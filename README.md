# parser-combinators
An early implementation of parser combinators implemented in Rust

Very much a work in progress at this point any suggestions or comments are welcome!
The API mostly mirrors the Haskell library [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) though at this point how each parser is created varies as this is something I havent finalized. Check the tests in src/lib.rs to see how the parsers are used.
